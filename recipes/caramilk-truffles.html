    <b>Ingredients</b> 
    <ul>
        <li>250g pkt Malt ‘O’ Milk biscuits</li>
        <li>50g (1/2 cup) flaked almonds, toasted</li>
        <li>3 x 180g blocks Cadbury Caramilk chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>395g can sweetened condensed milk</li>

    </ul>

    <b>Steps</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b> 
            Place biscuits and almonds in a food processor and process until fine crumbs form. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b> 
            Place one 180g block of Caramilk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on Medium, stirring every minute with a metal spoon, for 2-3 minutes or until melted and smooth. Add the melted chocolate, condensed milk and coconut to the biscuit mixture. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b> 
            Line a baking tray with baking paper. Roll 2 teaspoonfuls of the biscuit mixture into a ball. Transfer to prepared tray. Repeat with remaining biscuit mixture. Place in the freezer until firm.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b> 
            Place the remaining chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on Medium, stirring every minute with a metal spoon, for 2-3 minutes or until melted and smooth. Use a fork to dip balls in melted chocolate, allowing excess to drip off. Return to the tray. Place in the fridge until set. Serve.</li>
